# Cargo Do

Allows you to put multiple cargo commands on one line, e.g.

```
$ cargo do clean, update, build
```

## Using commas in your commands

Since `cargo-do` uses commas to delimit commands, you have to be careful when 
trying to run a command with a comma in it.

For example, this command will not run properly:

```
$ cargo do update, bench --bench "why are there commas, here", build
```

It will be treated as if you did this:

```
$ cargo update
$ cargo bench --bench "why are there commas
$ cargo  here"
$ cargo build
```

Which is obviously not what you want.

Because of the magic of shell escaping, you have a couple choices on how to get around this:

```
$ cargo do bench --bench "why are there commas\, here"
$ # or
$ cargo do bench --bench why are there commas \\, here
```

However you want to do it, `cargo-do` will not delimit commands on an escaped comma.
